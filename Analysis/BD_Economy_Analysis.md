---

## Bangladesh Economic Overview (FY2025-FY2026)

### Real GDP Growth:

## Inflation Dynamics

### Inflation Trajectory (% YoY):

| Period | Inflation Rate | Trend |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| July 2024 (Peak) | 11.7% | Double-digit inflation |
| July 2025 | 8.6% | Declining trajectory |
| October 2025 | 8.2% | Continued moderation |
| FY2026 Projection (ADB) | 8.0% | Elevated but declining |
| FY2030 Projection (IMF) | 5.54% | Approaching 5-6% central bank target |

### Root Causes of Inflation:

- **Currency Devaluation Pass-Through:** BDT depreciation 39.53% (Jan 2022 - Jan 2025) inflates import costs  
- **Supply-Side Shocks:** Global commodity prices, import pressures  
- **Demand-Side Factors:** Government spending on subsidies (Tk 279.79 crore in H1 FY25) and food stockpiling  
- **Energy Costs:** Fuel prices and electricity tariffs  
- **Wage Growth:** Inflation-driven wage pressures post-political unrest  

### Implications for Walton:

- **COGS Pressure:** Import-dependent raw materials face higher landed costs  
- **Pricing Power Limitation:** Domestic market price sensitivity amid inflation  
- **Working Capital:** Increased inventory financing costs at high interest rates  
- **Forex Losses:** Currency devaluation creates realized and unrealized FX losses

## Currency & Foreign Exchange Crisis

### Bangladeshi Taka Depreciation Trajectory:

| Period | BDT/USD Rate | Cumulative Depreciation |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| January 2022 | 83.93 | Baseline |
| January 2025 | 119.55 | -42.44% |
| May 2025 | 120.54 | -43.46% (peak) |
| November 2025 | 120.31 | -43.34% (stabilizing) |

### Foreign Exchange Reserves:

- **Current Level:** $32.15 billion (October 2025)  
- **Peak Level (Pre-Crisis):** ~$48 billion (early 2023)  
- **Recovery Trend:** Rebuilding after May 2025 exchange rate reform  
- **Months of Import Coverage:** Around 3.5 months (adequate but concerning)  

### Exchange Rate Policy Shift (May 2025):

- **New Regime:** Moved from managed float to more flexible exchange rate  
- **Objective:** Reduce pressure on forex reserves, allow market determination  
- **Impact:** Initial 5-7% devaluation spike; now stabilizing  
- **Central Bank Guidance:** Maintaining tight monetary conditions to rebuild reserves  

### Implications for Walton:

- **Import Cost Inflation:** Every 1% taka depreciation increases COGS by 0.3-0.5% (import-dependent)  
- **Finance Cost Burden:** Foreign currency loan repayments increase in BDT terms  
- **Export Opportunity:** Currency devaluation makes exports more competitive (positive for lithium battery export potential)  
- **Forex Losses:** Tk 123.6 crore recorded in FY2025; magnitude dependent on future depreciation  
- **Operational Hedging:** Limited natural hedges; export growth (46%) helps partially offset

### Credit Growth:

- **FY2024:** 9.8% private sector credit growth  
- **FY2025:** 6.0% private sector credit growth  
- **Trend:** Sharp deceleration due to tight monetary policy  

### Implications for Walton:

- **Increased Finance Costs:** Higher borrowing costs directly impact profitability  
- **WACC Expansion:** Equity cost of capital also higher due to macro uncertainty  
- **Working Capital Financing:** Increased inventory/receivables financing costs  
- **Capital Project Financing:** Lithium battery project (Tk 113.66 crore) financed at higher rates  
- **Dividend Capacity:** Higher debt servicing reduces available earnings for dividend

## Fiscal Policy & Government Spending

### Fiscal Deficit Dynamics:

| Period | Fiscal Deficit | Change | Key Driver |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| July-Nov 2023 | 0.03% of GDP | Baseline | Tight controls |
| July-Nov 2024 | 0.7% of GDP | +2233% | Subsidies & food stockpiling |

### Government Spending (July-Nov 2024):

- **Tax Revenue:** Declining 3% YoY (concerning trend)  

### Structural Fiscal Challenges:

- **Subsidies Burden:** Energy, fuel, food subsidies crowding out productive investment  
- **Infrastructure Spending:** Projects compete with welfare spending  
- **Debt Sustainability:** External debt ~$100 billion; fiscal pressure mounting  

### Implications for Walton:

- **Business Confidence:** Government financial stress reduces economic growth  
- **Regulatory Risk:** Pressure to increase taxes on profitable companies (electronics industry is target)  
- **VAT/Tax Changes:** Recent VAT increases on AC/refrigerators demonstrate revenue-raising pressure  
- **Infrastructure:** Limited government capex affects demand for Walton's industrial products (elevators, compressors)  
- **Consumer Demand:** Reduced purchasing power from fiscal consolidation

- Limited domestic alternatives for critical inputs  

#### Garment Sector Dominance:
