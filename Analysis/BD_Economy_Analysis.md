# Bangladesh Macroeconomic Environment (FY2025–FY2026)

---

## Bangladesh Economic Overview
Bangladesh’s economy is growing, but more slowly than before. Growth has come down because of high inflation, tighter policy, and political unrest.

### Real GDP Growth:

| Fiscal Year | Growth Rate | Key Drivers |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| FY2023 | 5.8% | Post-COVID recovery slowing |
| FY2024 | 4.2% | Tighter monetary policy |
| FY2025 | 3.7% | Political unrest (July-Aug 2024), policy tightening |
| FY2026 (Forecast- ADB) | 5.1% | Recovery post-stabilization |

In July–August 2024, there were large student‑led protests. These disrupted business activity for around 4–6 weeks. As a result many factories and shops were closed or operated at lower capacity and consumers delayed non‑essential purchases, including appliances. For Walton, this showed up as lower sales and profits in FY2025 (e.g., around 11% YoY earnings drop in H1) and slower recovery in demand, even after the protests ended. From FY2026 onward, growth is expected to improve again, but the environment is still not as easy as before.

## Inflation Dynamics
Inflation has been one of the most important macro challenges. It peaked in double digits and is now slowly easing, but still remains high.

### Inflation Trend (% YoY):

| Period | Inflation Rate | Trend |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| July 2024 (Peak) | 11.7% | Double-digit inflation |
| July 2025 | 8.6% | Declining trajectory |
| October 2025 | 8.2% | Continued moderation |
| FY2026 Projection (ADB) | 8.0% | Elevated but declining |
| FY2030 Projection (IMF) | 5.54% | Approaching 5-6% central bank target |

The taka depreciated around 39.5% vs USD between Jan 2022 and Jan 2025 [(LightCastle Analytics Wing)](https://lightcastlepartners.com/insights/2025/03/bangladesh-economic-growth-investment-challenges/). This sharply increased the local cost of imported raw materials and components. Global commodity prices and import dependence increased operational costs. Higher government spending on subsidies and food stockpiling supported demand but also added to inflation.

Customers are under pressure and are very price‑sensitive. So, Walton is unable to fully raise prices. Higher prices mean more cash tied up in inventories and receivables, and that cash is financed at high interest rates. Sharp exchange rate moves create both realized and unrealized FX losses, as seen in FY2025. In simple terms: high inflation and a weak currency increase Walton’s costs and make it harder to raise prices, squeezing margins.

## Currency & Foreign Exchange Crisis
Bangladesh has gone through a mini‑FX crisis with significant taka depreciation and pressure on reserves.

### Bangladeshi Taka Depreciation Trend:

| Period | BDT/USD Rate | Cumulative Depreciation |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| January 2022 | 83.93 | Baseline |
| January 2025 | 119.55 | -42.44% |
| May 2025 | 120.54 | -43.46% (peak) |
| November 2025 | 120.31 | -43.34% (stabilizing) |

In May 2025, the central bank shifted towards a more flexible exchange rate regime to reduce pressure on reserves. This caused a one‑time devaluation spike but has helped stabilization since then, combined with tighter monetary policy.
Every 1% depreciation in the taka can raise COGS by roughly 0.3–0.5% because so much of Walton’s input costs are import‑linked. Any foreign currency loans or payables become more expensive in BDT terms. On the positive side, a weaker taka makes Walton’s exports more competitive in foreign markets, which supports the export‑driven parts of the business (including potential battery exports). In FY2025, Walton reported around 123.6 crore in forex losses; the size of this item in future years will depend heavily on the stability of the exchange rate. Walton has some natural hedging through growing exports, but not enough to fully offset FX risk.

## Monetary Policy & Interest Rates
To fight inflation and protect the currency, Bangladesh has raised policy rates significantly.

### Policy Rate Evolution:

| Date | Policy Rate | Context |
|------|-------------|---------|
| September 2023 | 6.5% | Tightening begins |
| May 2024 | 8.5% | Inflation control focus |
| December 2024 | 10.0% | Peak tightening |
| October 2025-Present | 10.0% | Maintained at peak |

### Market Lending Rates:

| Period | Average Lending Rate | Trend |
|--------|------------------------|--------|
| September 2023 | 7.8% | Starting point |
| June 2024 | 11.5% | Sharp increase |
| July 2025 | 12.2% | Current peak |
| FY2026 Guidance | 11.5-12.0% | Likely to persist |

Short‑term and long‑term borrowing costs are significantly higher, directly reducing net profit. The cost of both debt and equity rises in this high‑rate, high‑risk environment, which depresses DCF valuations. More expensive inventory and receivables financing puts extra pressure on cash flows. The lithium battery project (113.66 crore) and other capex are financed at substantially higher interest rates, lengthening payback periods. Higher interest and principal payments leave less room for generous dividends. In short, the current monetary policy regime makes debt‑funded growth more expensive and risky.

## Fiscal Policy & Government Spending
The government has also faced fiscal pressures, balancing subsidies and welfare against weak revenue growth.

### Fiscal Deficit Dynamics:

| Period | Fiscal Deficit | Change | Key Driver |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| July-Nov 2023 | 0.03% of GDP | Baseline | Tight controls |
| July-Nov 2024 | 0.7% of GDP | +2233% | Subsidies & food stockpiling |

Bangladesh has a low tax‑to‑GDP ratio compared to regional peers, with ongoing issues in compliance and enforcement. At the same time, subsidies (fuel, energy, food) and welfare spending are high, while infrastructure spending also competes for limited resources. Fiscal strain and weak tax collection can weigh on overall growth and investor confidence. As the government searches for revenue, profitable sectors like electronics and appliances could see higher VAT, excise, or corporate tax rates. Recent VAT increases on ACs and refrigerators are warning signs. Limited fiscal space for infrastructure spending may slow industrial and construction activity, which affects demand for items like elevators and industrial equipment. Walton must be prepared for possible further tax and tariff changes as the government tries to stabilize public finances.

## Structural Economic Challenges
Beyond short‑term cycles, Bangladesh has several structural vulnerabilities that affect long‑term risk for companies like Walton.

### Key Vulnerabilities:

#### Remittance Dependency:
Annual worker remittances of around 20 billion USD (9–10% of GDP) are a major income source. Slower global growth or job losses abroad can hurt remittances, reducing household consumption at home.

#### Import Dependency:
Over 60% of manufacturing inputs (oil, machinery, raw materials, electronic components) are imported. This makes the economy and companies like Walton highly sensitive to FX moves and global supply disruptions. Local alternatives for many critical inputs are limited.

#### Garment Sector Dominance:
RMG accounts for over 80% of merchandise exports. Any shock to global apparel demand, trade policies, or compliance standards can hurt overall GDP and jobs, indirectly affecting domestic demand for appliances.

#### Financial Sector Fragility:
Non‑performing loans (NPLs) are officially >5%, but underlying stress may be higher. Some banks are undercapitalized and reluctant to lend aggressively. Weak credit quality can limit access to affordable financing for corporates.

#### External Imbalances:
Current account deficits have improved somewhat, but external debt and interest payments are rising. Import cover has fallen from >5 months to ~3.5 months, leaving less buffer for new shocks. For Walton, these structural challenges translate into higher long‑run risk, higher required returns (WACC), and greater volatility in cash flows.

## Opportunities in Bangladesh Macroeconomic Environment

### Positive Factors for Walton:

- **GDP Recovery Path:** From FY2026 onward, GDP growth is expected to normalize around 5%. Even at this level, it provides a decent base for appliance demand.  
- **Middle-Income Growth:** The gradual expansion of the middle class supports long‑term demand for consumer durables, especially “affordable quality” products where Walton is strong.  
- **Electrification & Appliance Penetration:** Growing rural electrification driving AC/TV/refrigerator demand  
- **Export Potential:** Currency depreciation improves export competitiveness (Walton 46% export growth in FY2025)  
- **Govt. Support:** Ongoing VAT exemptions and tax breaks for electronics manufacturing  
- **Regional Integration:** BIMSTEC/SAARC trade expansion opportunities  
- **Energy Transition:** Lithium battery project aligns with renewable energy push
