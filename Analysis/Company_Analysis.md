# COMPANY-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

## Acute Near-Term Operational Risks

### Political Disruption Legacy & Market Recovery (H2 FY2024–H1 FY2025)

#### Impact Timeline:
- July–August 2024 Uprising: Disrupted 4–6 weeks of operations (verified)
- Consumer confidence damage extended through FY2025
- Recovery Evidence: Q1 FY2026 showing 19.4% growth validates momentum
- Forward Risk: Normalized demand patterns may not sustain if macro conditions worsen

---

### Financial Impact (FY2025 Actuals)

- Revenue decline: **–5.7% YoY** (৳7,082 Cr vs. ৳7,512 Cr in FY2024)  
- Net profit decline: **–24.0% YoY** (৳1,036.62 Cr vs. ৳1,357 Cr in FY2024)  
- EPS decline: **–23.6%** (৳34.22 vs. ৳44.78 in FY2024)  
- Net Operating Cash Flow: **–67.8%** per share (৳58.20 in FY2025 vs. ৳56.96 in FY2024)

**DCF Assumption:** Base case assumes **10–12%** revenue growth resumption in FY2026E (supported by Q1 actual growth).  
If Q4 FY2025 disappoints, growth trajectory could compress by **300–400 bps**.

## Severe Margin Compression Dynamics

### Root Cause Analysis

| Cost Component            | FY2025 Actual | Pressure Level | YoY Change                       |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Gross Margin             | 25.8%         | Critical       | –200 bps from 27.3% (FY2024)     |
| Operating Margin         | 22.7%         | Severe         | –110 bps from 23.8% (FY2024)     |
| Finance Costs (% Sales)  | 6.33%         | Elevated       | +22 bps from 6.11% (FY2024)      |
| Forex Losses (Tk Crore)  | 123.6         | Major          | Taka depreciation impact         |

---

### Underlying Drivers (FY2025)

#### **Input Cost Inflation**
- COGS ratio increased **200+ bps** despite global commodity deflation  
- VAT increase: **7.5%** on refrigerators & air conditioners  
- Electronics components inflation + elevated shipping costs  

#### **Finance Cost Surge**
- Bangladesh Bank policy rate: **10.0%** (FY2025)  
- Walton borrowing rates: **12.10% short-term**, **7.57% long-term**  
- Forex losses: **৳123.6 Cr** (taka depreciation)  
- Finance costs increased to **6.33% of sales** (from 6.11%)

#### **Operating Leverage Breakdown**
- Operating profit decline: **–10.3%** vs. revenue decline **–5.7%**  
- SG&A not scaling down  
- Distribution cost higher due to extended dealer credit terms

#### **DCF Implications**
- Margin recovery assumed: **14.8–15.3%** by FY2030–35E  
- If inflation persists → terminal margin may fall **100–150 bps**  
- Sensitivity: **100 bps margin decline → 20–30 BDT/share valuation loss**

## Working Capital Pressure & Cash Flow Deterioration

### Current Ratio & Liquidity Trend

- FY2024: **2.23x** (healthy)  
- FY2025: **2.55x** (healthy, rising)  

### Root Causes
- Shift from bank borrowing → supplier credit  
- Inventory challenges due to demand uncertainty  
- Dealer credit terms extended  
- Payables prioritized over bank debt  

### Cash Conversion Cycle Stress
- Inventory holding period **extended** (slow-moving SKUs)  
- Receivables delayed (extended terms)  
- Payables aggressively extended  

**Net impact:** CCC becomes **40–50 days** (vs. 30–40 days normal)

**Risk:** WC need may rise **৳500–700 Cr** in FY2026–27 (merger + lithium project).  
Debt requirement may push leverage to **25–28% D/E**.

# DIVIDEND & CAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY

## Historical Dividend Patterns & FY2025 Dividend Cut

### Dividend History (FY2020–FY2025)

| Fiscal Year | Cash Dividend | Stock Dividend | Total Dividend Value | Payout Ratio |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| FY2020      | 200%         | —              | 200%                  | 75%+         |
| FY2021      | 400%         | —              | 400%                  | 104% (excess)|
| FY2022      | 350%         | —              | 350%                  | 72%          |
| FY2023      | 300%         | —              | 300%                  | 77%          |
| FY2024      | 350%         | —              | 350%                  | 94% (unsustainable) |
| FY2025      | 175%         | 10%            | 185%                  | 61.7%        |

### Key Observation: Significant Dividend Cut in FY2025
- Cash dividend reduced **50%** (from 350% → 175%)  
- Stock dividend (**10%**) added to compensate partially  
- Rationale: Cash preservation for lithium project (৳113.66 Cr)  
- Result:  
  - Cash return to investors ↓ significantly  
  - Equity diluted via stock dividend (~3%)

- FY2022: **72%**  
- FY2023: **77%**  
- FY2024: **94%** (very high, reserve draining)  
- FY2025: **61.7%** (normalized)

### Normalized Sustainable Range: **55–65%**

### Interpretation
- FY2025 cut signals **strategic shift toward capex-led growth**  
- Expected payout:  
  - During lithium project (FY2026–28) → **40–50%**  
  - After project & merger integration → higher payouts possible
