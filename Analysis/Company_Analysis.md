# COMPANY-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS

## Acute Near-Term Operational Risks

### Political Disruption Legacy & Market Recovery 
Walton’s recent performance has been heavily affected by the political unrest in July–August 2024. Operations were disrupted for around 4–6 weeks, and even after activity resumed, consumer confidence remained weak for the rest of FY2025. Many households delayed large purchases like appliances.
By Q1 FY2026, there are clear signs of recovery – revenue growth of about 19.46% shows that demand is coming back as the political situation stabilizes [(Q1 Un-Audited FS)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nj7SzscqWmpydUnLJwTOBqO4XGnAD2MY/view). However, this recovery is still fragile. If macro conditions worsen again (for example, renewed unrest or another shock), demand could slow and the recovery path might flatten.

### Financial Impact (FY2025 Actuals)

- Revenue decline: **–5.7% YoY** (৳7,082 Cr vs. ৳7,512 Cr in FY2024)  
- Net profit decline: **–24.0% YoY** (৳1,036.62 Cr vs. ৳1,357 Cr in FY2024)  
- EPS decline: **–23.6%** (৳34.22 vs. ৳44.78 in FY2024)  
- Net Operating Cash Flow: **–67.8%** per share (৳58.20 in FY2025 vs. ৳56.96 in FY2024)

In the DCF model, the base case assumes that this is a temporary dip and that revenue growth returns to around 10–12% in FY2026, supported by the strong Q1 FY2026 performance. If Q4 FY2025 and early FY2026 numbers disappoint, medium‑term growth might be closer to 7–8%, which would lower valuation by reducing the compounding effect over 10 years.

## Severe Margin Compression Dynamics
Walton has not only suffered from weaker demand but also from significant pressure on margins.

### Root Cause Analysis

| Cost Component            | FY2025 Actual | Pressure Level | YoY Change                       |
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Gross Margin             | 25.8%         | Critical       | –200 bps from 27.3% (FY2024)     |
| Operating Margin         | 22.7%         | Severe         | –110 bps from 23.8% (FY2024)     |
| Finance Costs (% Sales)  | 6.33%         | Elevated       | +22 bps from 6.11% (FY2024)      |
| Forex Losses (Tk Crore)  | 123.6         | Major          | Taka depreciation impact         |
Margins have fallen even though revenue declined only mid‑single digits. This shows that fixed costs, finance costs, and FX losses have had a strong negative effect.

### Underlying Drivers (FY2025)

#### **Input Cost Inflation**
- COGS ratio increased **200+ bps** despite global commodity deflation  
- VAT increase: **7.5%** on refrigerators & air conditioners  
- Electronics components inflation + elevated shipping costs  

#### **Finance Cost Surge**
- Bangladesh Bank policy rate: **10.0%** (FY2025)  
- Walton borrowing rates: **12.10% short-term**, **7.57% long-term**  
- Forex losses: **৳123.6 Cr** (taka depreciation)  
- Finance costs increased to **6.33% of sales** (from 6.11%)

#### **Operating Leverage Breakdown**
- Operating profit decline: **–10.3%** vs. revenue decline **–5.7%**  
- SG&A not scaling down  
- Distribution cost higher due to extended dealer credit terms

#### **DCF Implications**
The DCF model assumes that operating margins gradually recover, approaching 14.8–15.3% net margin by FY2030–2035, as inflation moderates and projects like lithium batteries and WDIL contribute. If inflation stays high or cost pressures persist, long‑term margins could end up 100–150 bps lower than in the base case. Roughly, a 100 bps reduction in terminal margin can reduce fair value by around 20–30 per share, making margin recovery a critical assumption.

## Working Capital Pressure & Cash Flow Deterioration

### Current Ratio & Liquidity Trend

- FY2024: **2.23x** (healthy)  
- FY2025: **2.55x** (healthy, rising)  

### Root Causes
- Shift from bank borrowing → supplier credit  
- Inventory challenges due to demand uncertainty  
- Dealer credit terms extended  
- Payables prioritized over bank debt  

### Cash Conversion Cycle Stress
- Inventory holding period **extended** (slow-moving SKUs)  
- Receivables delayed (extended terms)  
- Payables aggressively extended  

**Net impact:** CCC becomes **40–50 days** (vs. 30–40 days normal)

**Risk:** WC need may rise **৳500–700 Cr** in FY2026–27 (merger + lithium project).  
Debt requirement may push leverage to **25–28% D/E**.

---

## Medium-Term Strategic Risks: WDIL Merger & Lithium Battery Project

### WDIL Merger Execution Risk (High Impact)
The WDIL merger is strategically attractive – it adds IT products (laptops, desktops, mobiles, PCBs, e‑bikes) and deepens vertical integration. However, it also brings meaningful execution risk.

#### Deal Structure & Status
- MOU signed between WHIPLC & WDIL  
- WDIL portfolio: laptops, desktops, mobiles, PCBs, IT accessories, e-bikes  
- 123+ products across 36 brands  
- Rationale: Vertical integration, portfolio expansion, synergies  
- Pending approvals: shareholder, creditor, High Court

| IT Systems Integration   | Walton manufacturing vs WDIL IT-centric        | High     | 12–18 months    |
| Supply Chain Alignment   | Different vendor networks, QC standards        | High     | 9–12 months     |
| Organizational Structure | WDIL employees, reporting, HR alignment        | Medium   | 6–9 months      |
| Brand Management         | Maintaining WDIL identity                      | Medium   | Ongoing         |

---

### Synergy Realization Risk
- Target: **5–8%** cost reduction  
- Likely realization: **3–4 years**, not 2–3  

### Cross-Selling Challenges
- IT products require retail/online → different channels  
- Cannibalization risk  
- Walton brand stretch limitations  

### Regulatory & Legal Risks
- High Court approval delays  
- Creditor concerns (combined leverage)  
- Antitrust concerns (Walton refrigerator dominance)

**Approval Timeline:** 6–12 months; execution may slip to **H2 FY2027**

### Valuation Implication
- Base case: WDIL contributes **FY2027E onward**  
- Synergies assumed: **2–3%** vs. potential **5–8%**  
- Upside: **+10–15%** valuation  
- Downside: **–15–20%** valuation

---

## Lithium Battery Project Execution Risk (Highest Priority, ৳113.66 Cr Investment)
The lithium battery project is one of Walton’s most important future growth bets, but also one of the riskiest.

### Project Scope & Timeline
- Approved: **April 2025**  
- Investment: **৳113.66 Cr**  
- Location: Walton Hi-Tech Park (Gazipur)  
- Commercial production: **Mid–2026**  
- Technology partner: **Huawei**  
- Market: BTS towers, portable electronics  

### Execution Delay Risk
- Only **6+ months** into development by Apr 2025  
- Construction and permitting delays common  
- Huawei design not finalized  
- Realistic risk: **6–12 month delay**

### Market Adoption Risk

| Market Segment          | Volume Potential        | Adoption Risk | Notes                                          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| BTS Tower Replacement   | 500K–700K units/year    | Medium        | Slow replacement cycle                         |
| Portable Electronics    | Highly fragmented       | High          | Competition from Huawei, CATL                  |
| EV/E-bikes              | Emerging in Bangladesh  | Low           | Growing but small market                       |

---

### Competitive Threats
- Huawei, CATL, LG Chem → superior scale  
- Lithium batteries → commodity margins (8–12%)  
- Walton needs major production ramp  

### Technology & Quality Risk
- Yield rates <90% initially  
- High early-stage return rates  
- Lithium raw material volatility  

### Capital & Financing Risk
- Project Investment: **৳113.66 Cr**  
- WC Requirement: **৳20–30 Cr**  
- Total Capital Need: **৳135–145 Cr**  
- Funding: internal cash + **12%+** borrowing  
- Payback may extend to **4–5 years**  

### DCF Impact
The base case assumes meaningful EBIT contribution from around FY2029–2030. A one‑year delay and slightly lower margins could reduce the project’s present value by 15–30%, which translates into roughly 10–20 per share on the overall valuation.

## Macroeconomic Sensitivity Risks

### Currency Devaluation & Forex Loss Risk

#### Historical Context
- FY2025 Forex Loss: **৳123.6 Cr**  
- Taka depreciation continuing  
- Policy rate **10%**

#### Sensitivity Analysis

| Scenario | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Baseline:** 2–3% annual depreciation | Normal case |
| **5% further depreciation** | COGS +150–200 bps, forex loss +৳80–100 Cr, margin –200–250 bps |
| **10% further depreciation** | COGS +300–400 bps, forex loss +৳200+ Cr, margin –400–500 bps |

**Hedging:**  
- Exports (46% of production) offer natural hedge  
- Imports → 60% forex exposure  

**Risk:** 5–10% further depreciation → **৳150–200 Cr** profit hit.

---

### Interest Rate Risk & Rising Borrowing Costs

#### Current Environment (Dec 2025)
- Policy Rate: **10.00%**  
- Short-Term: **12.10%**  
- Long-Term: **7.57%**  
- Weighted Kd: **10.52%**  

#### Rate Rise Scenario

| Scenario | ST Borrowing | LT Borrowing | Kd Impact | Profitability Impact |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Base:** 10% PR | 12.1% | 7.57% | — | — |
| **Upside:** PR 11% | 13.5% | 8.5%+ | Kd → 11.5–12.0% | Margin –100–150 bps |
| **Severe:** PR 12% | 14%+ | — | Finance costs 8–9% of sales | Margin –250+ bps |

**Lithium Project Financing:**
- Additional cost: **৳13–14 Cr/year** (12% rate)  
- If rates rise → **৳14–16 Cr/year**  

**DCF:**  
+1% WACC → **30–50 BDT/share decline**

---

## Demand & Growth Risk (Macroeconomic Slowdown)

### Bangladesh Macro
- GDP growth: **5–6%**  
- RMG sector slowdown  
- Consumer discretionary highly elastic  

### Walton-Specific Risk

| Risk Factor               | Current State                     | Downside Scenario             | Impact                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Domestic Appliance Demand | Growing but constrained            | Growth slows to 3–5%          | Revenue CAGR 6% vs. 8% base                 |
| Export Growth             | 46% of FY2025 sales               | Global softness, tariffs       | Export growth slows to 5–8%                 |
| Consumer Confidence       | Recovering (+19.4% Q1 FY2026)     | Another disruption/recession   | Demand contracts                            |
| Replacement Cycles        | Normal                             | Extended                       | Market shrinks 10–15%                       |

**DCF impact:** EBIT 2035E may drop to **৳2,800–3,000 Cr** vs. base **৳4,096.87 Cr** → **15–25% valuation drop**.

---

## Inflation Persistence Risk

### Current Environment (H2 FY2025)
- CPI **8%+**  
- Food inflation **10%+**  
- Wage inflation **6–8%**  

### Risk Scenario
If inflation remains **>8% through FY2026–27**:
- Real wages negative  
- Purchasing power declines **5–10%**  
- Demand shifts to budget appliances  
- Margins pressured  
- Terminal margin may compress to **13–14%** (vs. 15.3% base)

---

## Competitive & Market Structure Risks

### Market Share Erosion

| Competitor | Positioning | Threat Level | Notes |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Samsung    | Premium, TV leader | Medium | Premium focus |
| LG         | Premium refrigerators, ACs | Medium | Established |
| Minister   | Budget segment | High | Aggressive pricing |
| Vision     | Budget brand | High | Strong local manufacturing |
| Singer     | Washing machines, cooking apps | High | Challenges Walton |
| Intl Imports | Mixed | Medium | Tariff-sensitive |

**Walton Market Share:**
- Refrigerators: **25–30%**
- TV: **20–25%**
- Washing Machines: **15–20%**

Risk: **200–300 bps** share loss → **৳100–150 Cr/year** revenue loss by FY2030.

---

### Price Competition & Margin Compression
- Budget competitors forcing price cuts  
- Structural margin pressure  
- Terminal margin risk: **13–14%** (vs. 15.3%)

---

### Regulatory Risks
- VAT increases (7.5% already implemented)  
- Corporate tax exemptions end **May 2027**  
- Tax rate may rise to **15–20%**

Impacts:
- Every +1% VAT → **50–80 bps COGS increase**  
- Tax rate rising from 11.5% → 22.5% → **5–10% net profit decline**


# DIVIDEND & CAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY

## Historical Dividend Patterns & FY2025 Dividend Cut

### Dividend History (FY2020–FY2025)

| Fiscal Year | Cash Dividend | Stock Dividend | Total Dividend Value | Payout Ratio |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| FY2020      | 200%         | —              | 200%                  | 75%+         |
| FY2021      | 400%         | —              | 400%                  | 104% (excess)|
| FY2022      | 350%         | —              | 350%                  | 72%          |
| FY2023      | 300%         | —              | 300%                  | 77%          |
| FY2024      | 350%         | —              | 350%                  | 94% (unsustainable) |
| FY2025      | 175%         | 10%            | 185%                  | 61.7%        |

In FY2025, Walton cut its cash dividend by 50% (from 350% to 175%) and introduced a 10% stock dividend to partly offset the perceived impact. FY2020–2024 dividends were generous but at times unsustainable. FY2025 marks a deliberate shift to a more balanced policy, with cash being preserved for major projects like the lithium battery plant. Shareholders experience lower cash returns in the short term, but the aim is to support long‑term growth and value creation.

## Payout Ratio Analysis & Sustainability

### FY2025 Payout Calculation (Verified)

| Item                        | Amount (৳ Crore) |
|-----------------------------|------------------|
| Net Profit                  | 1,036.62         |
| Cash Dividend (175%)        | 583              |
| Stock Dividend Nominal (10%)| 57               |
| **Total Dividend Distributed** | **640**      |
| **Cash Payout Ratio**       | **56.3%**        |
| **Total Payout Ratio**      | **61.7%**        |

### Historical Payout Ratio Trend
- FY2021: **104%** (unsustainable; reserve-funded)  
- FY2022: **72%**  
- FY2023: **77%**  
- FY2024: **94%** (very high, reserve draining)  
- FY2025: **61.7%** (normalized)

### Normalized Sustainable Range: **55–65%**

### Interpretation
- FY2025 cut signals **strategic shift toward capex-led growth**  
- Expected payout:  
  - During lithium project (FY2026–28) → **40–50%**  
  - After project & merger integration → higher payouts possible  

---

## Capital Allocation Strategy & Forward Priorities

### Strategic Shift in Capital Allocation (FY2026–2028)

#### **Priority 1: Lithium Battery Project**  
- Capex: **৳113.66 Cr + working capital**  
- Total Requirement: **৳135–145 Cr**  
- Payback: **4–5 years**  
- IRR: **8–12%**

#### **Priority 2: WDIL Merger Integration Capex**
- IT systems, rebranding, expansion  
- Capex: **৳20–30 Cr**  
- Timeline: FY2027–28  
- Integration: 12–18 months

#### **Priority 3: Core Business Capex**
- Maintenance + growth  
- Annual requirement: **3.5–4% of revenue**  
- Roughly **৳250–350 Cr** per year

#### **Priority 4: Working Capital Optimization**
Targets:
- Inventory days: reduce to **200 days**  
- Payables: extend with suppliers  
- Receivables: tighten dealer terms  

Expected Cash Release: **৳50–100 Cr**

#### **Priority 5: Debt Reduction (Selective)**
- D/E currently **22%**  
- Management target: **20–25%**  
- Not aiming for aggressive deleveraging; maintain flexibility

## Dividend Sustainability & Future Outlook

### Expected Dividend Policy (Forward)

| Period        | Expected Cash Dividend | Rationale |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------|
| FY2026-30+       | 40%               | Normalized cash generation |

### DCF Implication
Looking ahead, the DCF model assumes a 40% average payout ratio over the long term. This is conservative and leaves room for:
- Funding growth capex and working capital.
- Managing risk from macro volatility and interest rates.
If the lithium and WDIL projects perform better than expected (on time, on budget, and with stronger returns), there is upside for dividends to move back towards 50%+ of earnings from FY2028 onwards.

Finally, Walton is transitioning from a “high dividend, low reinvestment” phase to a “balanced reinvestment and dividend” phase. The long‑term success of this strategy depends heavily on execution of the major strategic projects and the stability of the macro environment.
