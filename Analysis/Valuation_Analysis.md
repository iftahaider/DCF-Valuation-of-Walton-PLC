## Valuation Summary & Overall Valuation Analysis

### Recommendation — HOLD 🧿

Walton Hi‑Tech Industries PLC is valued at **BDT 393.63 per share** using a discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, versus a current market price of **BDT 376.60**. The stock trades at a modest **4.52% discount** to intrinsic value, implying **limited upside and a balanced risk–reward profile**. The valuation is supported by an earnings recovery story, new growth drivers (WDIL merger, lithium‑ion battery project), and improving liquidity, but constrained by macro risks, execution uncertainty, and a high cost of capital.

#### Key Drivers:
🔸 **1. Strategic Growth Initiatives & Revenue Recovery**

Bangladesh's consumer durables sector is experiencing strong demand recovery supported by rising middle-class consumption, rural electrification, and replacement cycles of aging appliances. Walton's strategic initiatives, such as the WDIL merger and the lithium battery project, provide structural growth drivers that support revenue expansion of 6.8% CAGR through FY2035. Q1 FY2026 growth of +19.4% validates recovery momentum despite FY2025 political disruption legacy.

🔸 **2. Margin Expansion Assumption Requires Flawless Execution**

Walton is well-positioned for EBIT margin recovery from 20.93% (FY2025) to 26.0% (FY2031+) through three channels: COGS normalization as inflation moderates, WDIL synergies (3–5% cost reduction), and lithium battery scale economies. Medium-term EBITDA margin expansion to 29%+ appears achievable given competitive positioning, cost discipline, and diversification into higher-margin IT products and battery segments. Downside risks are manageable if synergies realize as planned.

🔸 **3. Balance Sheet Stability & Manageable Cost of Capital**

Key balance sheet strengths include:

- Moderate leverage (22% D/E, target 20–25% range sustainable)
- Working capital optimization underway; current ratio healthy at 2.55x
- Hi-Tech Park tax exemption extends through May 2027, providing profitability buffer
- Manageable debt maturity profile; refinancing risk contained

Together, these factors support equity value creation potential aligned with 16.71% WACC assumption.


🔸 **4. DCF-Implied Value Is Meaningfully Lower**

| Metric                     | Value        |
|----------------------------|-------------:|
| Intrinsic Value per Share | BDT 393.63          |
| Market Price (Dec 2025)   | BDT 376.60       |
| Implied Overvaluation     | 4.52% upside|
| Recommendation            | **HOLD**     |

The DCF-implied intrinsic value of **BDT 393.63 per share** sits at par with the prevailing market price of BDT 376.00, implying roughly **4.52%** modest upside. The valuation reflects conservative base-case assumptions on margin recovery, project execution, and macro stability. Given balanced risk–reward, the recommended stance is **HOLD** at current levels, with accumulation preferred below 350.

## Market Comparison

| Metric                            | Value (BDT) |
|-----------------------------------|------------:|
| DCF Fair Value per Share          | **393.63**  |
| Current Market Price (3rd Dec 2025)   | **376.60**  |
| Implied Discount to Fair Value    | **≈ 4.5%**  |
| 52‑Week High                      | 750.00      |
| 52‑Week Low                       | 373.40      |

**Interpretation:** The stock trades **slightly below** intrinsic value but without a deep margin of safety. Price is near the lower end of its 52‑week range, reflecting macro and sector concerns. Valuation is **not compellingly cheap**, but also does not justify a clear SELL.


## Sensitivity Analysis (WACC vs Terminal Growth)

**Fair Value per Share (BDT)**

| g \ WACC | 14.0% | 15.0% | 16.71% | 17.0% | 18.0% |
|----------|------:|------:|-------:|------:|------:|
| **2.0%** | 471.81| 431.00| 373.89 |365.41 |338.64 |

| **5.0%** | 535.14| 479.63| 406.04 |395.48 |362.75 |

Key points:

- **Base case** (16.71% WACC, 4.0% g): **BDT 393.63**
- **Upside scenarios** (lower WACC / higher g) can justify **BDT 450–535** per share.
- **Downside scenarios** (higher WACC / lower g) cluster around **BDT 340–380**.
- Current market price (**BDT 376.60**) lies slightly **below** the conservative base case.


## Conclusion

At BDT 376.60, Walton appears modestly undervalued relative to the base‑case intrinsic value of BDT 393.63, but the upside is not large enough to classify the stock as a strong BUY. Given the balance between recovery potential and macro/execution risk, the valuation supports a HOLD / MARKET PERFORM recommendation. A more attractive entry point would be below BDT 350–360, while profit‑taking becomes more compelling above BDT 450–470, assuming unchanged fundamentals.
