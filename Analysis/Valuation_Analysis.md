#### Cost of Capital (WACC) Inputs

**Risk‑free rate adjustment (Damodaran approach):**

- Bangladesh 10Y Government Bond: **10.42%**
- Less: Country default spread: **8.14%**

| Component | Value (BDT Cr) | Weight |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| Equity   | 12,605.8        | 82.52%  |
| Debt     |  2,669.7         | 17.48%  |

### 4. Market Comparison

| Metric                            | Value (BDT) |
|-----------------------------------|------------:|
| DCF Fair Value per Share          | **393.63**  |
| Current Market Price (Dec 2025)   | **376.60**  |
| Implied Discount to Fair Value    | **≈ 4.5%**  |
| 52‑Week High                      | 750.00      |
| 52‑Week Low                       | 373.40      |

**Interpretation:** The stock trades **slightly below** intrinsic value but without a deep margin of safety. Price is near the lower end of its 52‑week range, reflecting macro and sector concerns. Valuation is **not compellingly cheap**, but also does not justify a clear SELL.

### Sensitivity Analysis (WACC vs Terminal Growth)

**Fair Value per Share (BDT)**

| g \ WACC | 14.0% | 15.0% | 16.71% | 17.0% | 18.0% |
|----------|------:|------:|-------:|------:|------:|
| **2.0%** | 471.81| 431.00| 373.89 |365.41 |338.64 |
| **3.0%** | 489.08| 444.51| 383.04 |374.00 |345.60 |
| **4.0%** | 509.81| 460.47| **393.63** |383.92 |353.56 |
| **5.0%** | 535.14| 479.63| 406.04 |395.48 |362.75 |

Key points:

- **Base case** (16.71% WACC, 4.0% g): **BDT 393.63**
- **Upside scenarios** (lower WACC / higher g) can justify **BDT 450–535** per share.
- **Downside scenarios** (higher WACC / lower g) cluster around **BDT 340–380**.
- Current market price (**BDT 376.60**) lies slightly **below** the conservative base case.

### Key Value Drivers

**Positive drivers:**

1. **Earnings recovery:**  
   EPS rises from **BDT 34.22 (2025A)** to **BDT 68.84 (2035E)**, driven by normalizing demand, cost discipline, and new segment contributions.

2. **Revenue growth & diversification:**  
   Revenue grows from **BDT 7,082 Cr (2025A)** to **BDT 12,610 Cr (2035E)** (CAGR ~6.1%). New businesses (WDIL IT products, lithium batteries, elevators, service parts) reduce dependence on refrigerators.

3. **Margin stabilisation:**  
   Gross margin remains around **36%**, while EBIT margin gradually improves from ~21% (2025A) to **26%** in terminal years, reflecting operating leverage and better product mix.

4. **Improving liquidity:**  
   Current and quick ratios trend up, indicating tighter working‑capital management and lower refinancing risk.

5. **Tax incentives:**  
   0% tax through FY2028 and partial exemption through FY2031 meaningfully support free cash flows in the early forecast years.

**Key risks:**

1. **Macro & FX risk:**  
   Elevated inflation, FX volatility and potential further devaluation of BDT can pressure margins and demand.

2. **Execution risk (WDIL & lithium project):**  
   Integration delays, cost overruns, or slower adoption could dilute the expected value contribution from these initiatives.

3. **Competitive intensity:**  
   Strong competition from local and foreign brands in key categories (refrigerators, ACs, TVs) may limit pricing power.

4. **High WACC:**  
   A 16.71% discount rate materially suppresses valuation; any further increase in perceived risk would lower fair value.

---

**Conclusion:**

At **BDT 376.60**, Walton appears **modestly undervalued** relative to the base‑case intrinsic value of **BDT 393.63**, but the upside is **not large enough** to classify the stock as a strong BUY. Given the balance between recovery potential and macro/execution risk, the valuation supports a **HOLD / MARKET PERFORM** recommendation. A more attractive **entry point** would be **below BDT 350–360**, while **profit‑taking** becomes more compelling above **BDT 450–470**, assuming unchanged fundamentals.
