## 📊 Financial Models

### 1. Revenue Forecast

![Revenue Forecast](Charts/Revenue_Forecast.png)

> This shows the revenue trend from 2021A to 2035E, including VAT adjustments. Revenue crashed 18.7% in 2023A due to FX crisis; recovers from 2024A.

### 2. Historical & Projected Income Statement

![Income Statement Model](Charts/Income_Statement.png)

> This shows forecasted revenue from 2021A to 2035E, COGS, gross profit, and operating expense modeling, EBITDA, EBIT, tax, and net profit progression and EPS calculation and growth trend. EBIT margin temporarily compressed to 20.9% (2025A); forecast to recover to 26% by 2032E. Net margin improves from 14.6% (2025A) to 16–19% (forecast), supported by VAT relief and operational leverage.

### 3. Balance Sheet & Operating Assets Schedule

![Balance Sheet Model](Charts/Balance_Sheet.png)

> This shows current and non-current assets (cash, receivables, inventory, fixed assets), current and non-current liabilities (payables, debt, deferred tax), Shareholders' equity bridge (retained earnings, revaluation reserves) and operating assets net schedule tied to capex and depreciation. Current ratio rises from 1.55 (2022) to 2.50+ (2025A), indicating stronger working capital management. Debt remains static; leverage ratios improve as EBITDA recovers. Cash balance grows from BDT 507 Cr (2025A) to BDT 2,599 Cr (2035E), supporting dividend sustainability.

### 4. Cash Flow Statement

![Cash Flow Statement](Charts/Cashflow_Statement.png)

> This shows operating, investing, and financing cash flows, free cash flow generation (before financing activities), sources and uses of cash and net cash position bridge. Operating CF moves from BDT 1,763 Cr (2025A) to over BDT 2,100 Cr (forecast), showing improving operational cash generation. Capex commitment thorugh consistent investment at 7.86% of revenue, including BDT 114 Cr one-time lithium project capex in 2026. A disciplined dividend policy, 40% payout ratio on earnings, provides growth capital while returning value to shareholders.

## 💰 DCF Valuation Analysis

### 1. WACC Calculation Summary
![WACC Sensitivity](Charts/WACC_Summary.png)

> This chart shows Walton’s capital structure and cost of capital components used in the WACC calculation. The pie chart indicates an equity‑heavy structure, with equity comprising roughly four‑fifths of financing. The bar chart compares the after‑tax cost of debt with the higher cost of equity, and the dashed line highlights the resulting weighted average cost of capital applied in the DCF valuation.

### 2. Debt Schedule & Interest Coverage

![Debt Schedule](Charts/Debt_Schedule.png)

> This shows total debt composition (short-term and long-term) and interest expense calculation. Here, a minimum cash cushion of BDT 50 crores is assumed. Also, the other finance costs include excise Duty, bank charges + FX loss. The interest income rate is assumed to be usually 1–3% of cash. The main issue I faced here was a circular reference error. Paul Pignataro's book and YouTube videos have helped me fix this issue. 

### 3. DCF Value Build-Up

![DCF Value Build-Up](Charts/DCF_Chart.png)

> This shows the calculation of FCFF from EBIT, the present value of a 10-year explicit forecast FCFF, the terminal value calculation (Gordon Growth model), the enterprise value composition, the bridge to equity value (debt and cash adjustments), and the per-share valuation.

## 📈 Key Valuation Charts

### Chart 1: Revenue Trend (2021–2035)

![Revenue Forecast](Charts/Revenue_Trend.png)

> This chart shows Walton’s net revenue and year‑on‑year growth from 2021A to 2035E. The blue line tracks absolute revenue, while the red dashed line shows growth percentages. The dotted vertical line separates historical data from forecasts. The series highlights a temporary contraction followed by recovery and then a gradual normalisation of growth as the company matures and incremental expansion moderates.


### Chart 2: Walton's Revenue by Product
![Revenue by Product](Charts/Walton_Revenue.png)

> This area chart shows how Walton’s total revenue is distributed across major product segments over time. Refrigerators remain the core contributor, while air conditioners, home appliances, and service parts gradually increase their shares. New segments, particularly WDIL IT products and lithium batteries, start contributing from 2026–2027E, illustrating diversification and future growth drivers beyond the legacy refrigerator business.

### Chart 3: Operating Performance – EBIT & Margin Expansion

![EBIT Trend](Charts/EBIT_Margin_Trends.png)

> This chart shows Walton’s operating performance by combining EBIT levels with EBIT margin percentages over time. The green bars represent absolute EBIT, while the light line tracks margin evolution. The pattern indicates an initial period of margin compression followed by progressive improvement, supported by operating leverage, cost discipline, and benefits from scale and integration, leading to both rising earnings and healthier profitability ratios.

### Chart 4: Profitability Margin Analysis

![Profitability Margins](Charts/Profitability_Margins.png)

> This chart shows the evolution of gross margin, EBIT margin, and net margin across historical and forecast years. Gross margin stabilises around 36%, while EBIT and net margins dip during the stress period and gradually recover. Over the forecast horizon, margins expand as operating efficiency improves, VAT/tax incentives materialise, and higher‑margin products and services contribute more to overall profitability.

#### Key Metrics

- **Gross Margin:** 36.05% (2025) → 40% (2035E)  
- **EBIT Margin:** 20.93% → 26.00% by FY2031+  
- **Net Margin:** 14.64% → 16.54% by 2035E  
- **Tax:** Hi-Tech Park exemption ends May 2027; effective tax normalizes to ~22.5%.

### Chart 5: Historical Liquidity Ratios 

![Liquidity Ratios](Charts/Historical_Liquidity_Ratios.png)

> This chart shows the trend in Walton’s current, quick, and cash ratios from 2021 to 2025. Liquidity weakens slightly around 2022 but improves steadily thereafter, with both current and quick ratios trending upwards. The pattern indicates that, despite short-term pressures, the company has strengthened its ability to cover short-term obligations, while maintaining prudent levels of cash and near‑cash assets.

### Chart 6: Earnings Per Share (EPS) Trend

![EPS Trend](Charts/EPS_Trend.png)

> This chart shows the historical and projected earnings per share (EPS) of Walton from 2021A to 2035E. EPS declines sharply after 2021 due to macroeconomic and operational headwinds, then begins recovering from 2026E. Over the forecast period, EPS grows steadily, reflecting profitability restoration, operating leverage, and contributions from new projects and the WDIL integration.

### Chart 7: DCF Value Build‑Up

![EV Build-up](Charts/EV_Buildup.png)

> This column chart shows how the DCF‑based equity value is constructed. The first bars present the present value of projected free cash flows and terminal value, which together form enterprise value. Subsequent bars deduct debt and add cash to arrive at total equity value. The chart provides a transparent bridge from operating performance to the final per‑share valuation figure used in the investment conclusion.

### Chart 8: DCF Sensitivity – WACC vs Terminal Growth Rate

![WACC Sensitivity](Charts/WACC_Sensitivity_Heatmap.png)

> This heatmap demonstrates how Walton’s intrinsic value per share changes under alternative combinations of WACC and terminal growth rates. Each cell reports the implied fair value, with warmer colours indicating lower values and cooler colours higher values. The blue‑outlined cell marks the base‑case assumption set. The grid visually communicates valuation risk, showing both downside scenarios and upside potential if risk perceptions or growth outlook improve.

**Note:** Two charts have been created using Python Code with the guidance of Google Gemini.

| Current Market Price | BDT 376.60 |
| Implied Discount to Fair Value | 4.52% |
| Recommendation | **HOLD** |

### Positive Drivers

- **Earnings recovery:** EPS to double from BDT 34 to BDT 69 over 10 years  
- **Revenue diversification:** New segments (WDIL IT, lithium batteries) reduce concentration risk  
- **Margin improvement:** EBIT margin recovers to 26%, supported by operating leverage  
- **Improving liquidity:** Current ratio strengthens above 2.5x  
- **Tax incentives:** 0% tax through 2028 provides cash-flow boost  

### Risk Factors

- **Macro uncertainty:** FX volatility, inflation, political instability  
- **Execution risk:** WDIL merger integration and lithium-battery project success uncertain  
- **Competitive pressure:** Strong local and foreign competition in key categories  
- **High WACC:** 16.71% reflects Bangladesh risk premium; any increase lowers valuation  
- **Limited margin of safety:** At only 4.5% upside, stock offers little cushion  

### Investment Action Items

| Action | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| **BUY** | Below BDT 350–360 (>10% upside to fair value) |
| **HOLD** | BDT 360–420 (fair value range with acceptable risk) |
| **SELL / TRIM** | Above BDT 450–470 (limited upside, risks outweigh rewards) |

|--------|------:|------:|----------:|
| Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) | 225 | 200 | Inventory efficiency gains |
| Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) | 189 | 180 | Dealer credit tightening |
| Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) | 24 | 30 | Better supplier terms |

#### CapEx & Depreciation

- **Regular CapEx:** 7.86% of revenue (supporting growth and replacement)
- **Lithium Project CapEx:** BDT 113.66 Cr one-time in 2026E
- **D&A rate:** 3.22% of opening operating assets

#### WACC Components

- Detailed explanations can be found in the WACC_Analysis folder

#### Terminal Assumptions

- **Terminal growth rate (g):** 4.0%
  - Below Bangladesh long-run nominal GDP growth (~5–6%)
  - Ensures company does not outgrow economy in perpetuity
  - Conservative estimate given mature operating model


## 📌 Limitations of this Model
I acknowledge that this model has some limitations. These are as follows:
- Revenue, margin, capex, and working capital forecasts are based on assumptions rather than management guidance.
- The model is extremely sensitive to small changes in WACC and terminal growth, causing large swings in fair value.
- Beta is estimated from DSEX, which is a shallow and sometimes illiquid market. Regression-based beta for emerging markets may not reflect the true systematic risk of the company.
- For calculating depreciation & amortization, I grouped PPE, Intangible Assets, and Right-of-Use Assets as operating assets. However, Paul Pignataro showed a more detailed process for creating depreciation and working capital schedules. But due to a lack of data and expertise, I couldn't make such detailed ones. 
- I assumed Walton would successfully conduct its merger of WDIL and undertake the lithium battery project. Here, I have made some simplistic assumptions. A thorough M&A and Project analysis would lead to more accurate results.
- Forecast capex includes a large lithium battery expansion whose returns are unpredictable.
- The debt schedule has been created following Paul Pignataro's guidance. However, this could have been designed more accurately.
- Paul Pignataro showed two major methods for calculating the terminal value, including the Multiple method and the Perpetuity method. But for this project, I followed only the Perpetuity method.
- Finally, Walton reported its Cash Flow Statement using the Direct Method. But I followed the converted indirect version of the Cash Flow Statement from StockAnalysis. So, there may be some mistakes due to StockAnalysis's classification issue.
