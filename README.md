## Financial Performance & Forecast

### Chart 1: Revenue Trend (2021–2035)

![Revenue Forecast](Charts/Revenue_Trend.png)

> This chart shows Walton’s net revenue and year‑on‑year growth from 2021A to 2035E. The blue line tracks absolute revenue, while the red dashed line shows growth percentages. The dotted vertical line separates historical data from forecasts. The series highlights a temporary contraction followed by recovery and then a gradual normalisation of growth as the company matures and incremental expansion moderates.

#### Investment Insight

If quarterly growth slips materially below +10% in FY2026–2027, it would indicate downside risk vs. the modeled recovery pace.

### Chart 2: Walton's Revenue by Product
![Revenue by Product](Charts/Walton_Revenue.png)

> This area chart shows how Walton’s total revenue is distributed across major product segments over time. Refrigerators remain the core contributor, while air conditioners, home appliances, and service parts gradually increase their shares. New segments, particularly WDIL IT products and lithium batteries, start contributing from 2026–2027E, illustrating diversification and future growth drivers beyond the legacy refrigerator business.

### Chart 3: Operating Performance – EBIT & Margin Expansion

![EBIT Trend](Charts/EBIT_Margin_Trends.png)

> This chart shows Walton’s operating performance by combining EBIT levels with EBIT margin percentages over time. The green bars represent absolute EBIT, while the light line tracks margin evolution. The pattern indicates an initial period of margin compression followed by progressive improvement, supported by operating leverage, cost discipline, and benefits from scale and integration, leading to both rising earnings and healthier profitability ratios.

#### Investment Insight

Gross margin consistently below 36% would signal pricing power or cost-control issues, putting the margin recovery thesis at risk.


### Chart 4: Profitability Margin Analysis

![Profitability Margins](Charts/Profitability_Margins.png)

> This chart shows the evolution of gross margin, EBIT margin, and net margin across historical and forecast years. Gross margin stabilises around 36%, while EBIT and net margins dip during the stress period and gradually recover. Over the forecast horizon, margins expand as operating efficiency improves, VAT/tax incentives materialise, and higher‑margin products and services contribute more to overall profitability.

#### Key Metrics

- **Gross Margin:** 36.05% (2025) → 40% (2035E)  
- **EBIT Margin:** 20.93% → 26.00% by FY2031+  
- **Net Margin:** 14.64% → 16.54% by 2035E  
- **Tax:** Hi-Tech Park exemption ends May 2027; effective tax normalizes to ~22.5%.

#### Investment Insight

If WDIL integration is delayed by more than 2 years, terminal margins could be 1–2 percentage points lower, cutting fair value by ~50–75 per share.


### Chart 5: Historical Liquidity Ratios 

![Liquidity Ratios](Charts/Historical_Liquidity_Ratios.png)

> This chart shows the trend in Walton’s current, quick, and cash ratios from 2021 to 2025. Liquidity weakens slightly around 2022 but improves steadily thereafter, with both current and quick ratios trending upwards. The pattern indicates that, despite short-term pressures, the company has strengthened its ability to cover short-term obligations, while maintaining prudent levels of cash and near‑cash assets.

#### Investment Insight

For investors, it is a good sign that the company will have fewer liquidity crises in the coming years.


### Chart 6: Earnings Per Share (EPS) Trend

![EPS Trend](Charts/EPS_Trend.png)

> This chart shows the historical and projected earnings per share (EPS) of Walton from 2021A to 2035E. EPS declines sharply after 2021 due to macroeconomic and operational headwinds, then begins recovering from 2026E. Over the forecast period, EPS grows steadily, reflecting profitability restoration, operating leverage, and contributions from new projects and the WDIL integration.

#### Investment Insight

For dividend-focused investors, meaningful and sustainable cash yields appear more attractive from FY2028 onward, once capex intensity normalizes.


### Chart 7: WACC Calculation Summary

![WACC Sensitivity](Charts/WACC_Summary.png)

> This chart shows Walton’s capital structure and cost of capital components used in the WACC calculation. The pie chart indicates an equity‑heavy structure, with equity comprising roughly four‑fifths of financing. The bar chart compares the after‑tax cost of debt with the higher cost of equity, and the dashed line highlights the resulting weighted average cost of capital applied in the DCF valuation.

#### Investment Insight

The high 16.71% WACC is largely driven by a high Cost of Equity (18.29%) due to the company's reliance on equity financing (82.5%). This indicates a high required return for shareholders to compensate for perceived risk.


### Chart 8: DCF Value Build‑Up

![EV Build-up](Charts/EV_Buildup.png)

> This column chart shows how the DCF‑based equity value is constructed. The first bars present the present value of projected free cash flows and terminal value, which together form enterprise value. Subsequent bars deduct debt and add cash to arrive at total equity value. The chart provides a transparent bridge from operating performance to the final per‑share valuation figure used in the investment conclusion.

#### Investment Insight

Because 27.83% of EV is terminal, small changes in long‑run margins, WACC, or growth move equity value substantially. Debt discipline and capital allocation decisions are key levers for incremental upside or downside.


### Chart 9: DCF Sensitivity – WACC vs Terminal Growth Rate

![WACC Sensitivity](Charts/WACC_Sensitivity_Heatmap.png)

> This heatmap demonstrates how Walton’s intrinsic value per share changes under alternative combinations of WACC and terminal growth rates. Each cell reports the implied fair value, with warmer colours indicating lower values and cooler colours higher values. The blue‑outlined cell marks the base‑case assumption set. The grid visually communicates valuation risk, showing both downside scenarios and upside potential if risk perceptions or growth outlook improve.

**Note:** Two charts have been created using Python Code with the guidance of Google Gemini.

## Investment Thesis & Recommendation

### Recommendation — HOLD 🧿

This analysis views Walton Hi‑Tech as approximately **fairly valued** with modest upside at the current market price of BDT 376.60 versus a DCF‑implied fair value of BDT 393.63. The stock offers a balanced risk–reward profile: meaningful long‑term growth drivers offset by macro, execution, and valuation risks. A **HOLD** stance is therefore appropriate.

### 🔸 1. Strategic Growth Initiatives & Revenue Recovery

Bangladesh's consumer durables sector is experiencing strong demand recovery supported by rising middle-class consumption, rural electrification, and replacement cycles of aging appliances. Walton's strategic initiatives, such as the WDIL merger and the lithium battery project, provide structural growth drivers that support revenue expansion of 6.8% CAGR through FY2035. Q1 FY2026 growth of +19.4% validates recovery momentum despite FY2025 political disruption legacy.

### 🔸 2. Margin Expansion Assumption Requires Flawless Execution

Walton is well-positioned for EBIT margin recovery from 20.93% (FY2025) to 26.0% (FY2031+) through three channels: COGS normalization as inflation moderates, WDIL synergies (3–5% cost reduction), and lithium battery scale economies. Medium-term EBITDA margin expansion to 29%+ appears achievable given competitive positioning, cost discipline, and diversification into higher-margin IT products and battery segments. Downside risks are manageable if synergies realize as planned.

### 🔸 3. Balance Sheet Stability & Manageable Cost of Capital

Key balance sheet strengths include:

- Moderate leverage (22% D/E, target 20–25% range sustainable)
- Working capital optimization underway; current ratio healthy at 2.55x
- Hi-Tech Park tax exemption extends through May 2027, providing profitability buffer
- Manageable debt maturity profile; refinancing risk contained

Together, these factors support equity value creation potential aligned with 16.71% WACC assumption.


### 🔸 4. DCF-Implied Value Is Meaningfully Lower

| Metric                     | Value        |
|----------------------------|-------------:|
| Intrinsic Value per Share | BDT 393.63          |
| Market Price (Dec 2025)   | BDT 376.60       |
| Implied Overvaluation     | 4.52% upside|
| Recommendation            | **HOLD**     |

The DCF-implied intrinsic value of **BDT 393.63 per share** sits at par with the prevailing market price of BDT 376.00, implying roughly **4.52%** modest upside. The valuation reflects conservative base-case assumptions on margin recovery, project execution, and macro stability. Given balanced risk–reward, the recommended stance is **HOLD** at current levels, with accumulation preferred below 350.

## 📌 Limitations of this Model
I acknowledge that this model has some limitations. These are as follows:
- Revenue, margin, capex, and working capital forecasts are based on assumptions rather than management guidance.
- The model is extremely sensitive to small changes in WACC and terminal growth, causing large swings in fair value.
- Beta is estimated from DSEX, which is a shallow and sometimes illiquid market. Regression-based beta for emerging markets may not reflect the true systematic risk of the company.
- For calculating depreciation & amortization, I grouped PPE, Intangible Assets, and Right-of-Use Assets as operating assets. However, Paul Pignataro showed a more detailed process for creating depreciation and working capital schedules. But due to a lack of data and expertise, I couldn't make such detailed ones. 
- I assumed Walton would successfully conduct its merger of WDIL and undertake the lithium battery project. Here, I have made some simplistic assumptions. A thorough M&A and Project analysis would lead to more accurate results.
- Forecast capex includes a large lithium battery expansion whose returns are unpredictable.
- The debt schedule has been created following Paul Pignataro's guidance. However, this could have been designed more accurately.
- Paul Pignataro showed two major methods for calculating the terminal value, including the Multiple method and the Perpetuity method. But for this project, I followed only the Perpetuity method.
- Finally, Walton reported its Cash Flow Statement using the Direct Method. But I followed the converted indirect version of the Cash Flow Statement from StockAnalysis. So, there may be some mistakes due to StockAnalysis's classification issue.
